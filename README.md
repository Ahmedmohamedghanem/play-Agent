X and O Game
This project implements a command-line version of the classic X and O (Tic-Tac-Toe) game. The game is played between two players, X and O, on a 3x3 grid.

Rules
The rules of the game are simple:

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player X always goes first and player O goes second.
Players take turns to mark a vacant spot on the grid with their respective symbols (X or O).
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all spots on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
Getting Started
To play the X and O game, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy
cd x-o-game
Run the game script using Python:

shell
Copy
python xo_game.py
The game will display the initial empty grid and prompt the players to enter their moves.

Enter the row and column numbers to mark your spot on the grid. For example, to mark the top-right spot, enter 1 3.

The game will continue until there is a winner or a draw. The final result will be displayed, and you can choose to play again.
